Djebel is a minimalistic, super-fast web application framework that takes the best ideas from WordPress ‚Äî like hooks, filters, themes, and plugins ‚Äî and reimagines them for modern web development.

Unlike traditional frameworks that assume what you need, Djebel assumes nothing. It's completely plugin-based, letting YOU decide what your application becomes.

Think of Djebel as the Swiss Army knife of web development: compact, powerful, and adaptable to any project.

## üöÄ Who is Djebel For?

Djebel is perfect for developers and agencies who need to build:

- **Landing Pages** ‚Äî Fast-loading, conversion-focused pages
- **Mini Web Applications** ‚Äî Lightweight tools and utilities  
- **Dashboards** ‚Äî Clean, data-driven interfaces
- **Rapid Prototypes** ‚Äî Quick proof-of-concept applications
- **Influencer Mini Sites** ‚Äî Personal brand sites with bio links, content showcase, and social integration
- **AI-Generated Websites** ‚Äî Perfect foundation for programmatically created sites
- **Custom Web Solutions** ‚Äî When you need full control without bloat

If you've ever felt frustrated by heavy frameworks that force you into their way of doing things, Djebel is your answer.

## üí° Business-First Philosophy: Solve Problems, Not Impress Developers

Djebel isn't about chasing the latest programming trends or impressing other developers. 
It's about **solving real business problems, fast**.

### Why This Matters:
- **Clients don't care about your technology stack** ‚Äî They want their problems solved
- **Simple code is maintainable code** ‚Äî Less complexity means fewer bugs
- **Speed to market beats perfect architecture** ‚Äî Get solutions deployed quickly
- **Easy plugin creation** ‚Äî No need to learn 100 different patterns and conventions

## üîå Plugin Development Made Simple

Djebel's plugin system is designed to be approachable and powerful. Creating a plugin is as simple as writing a PHP function with a proper header.

**No complex interfaces to implement, no dependency injection to configure, no abstract factories to understand. Just write functions that solve problems.**

### Learn from Real Examples

Check out the official plugin repository at [@djebel-app-plugins](https://github.com/djebel-app-plugins) to see real-world plugin implementations:

- **[djebel-creator-links](https://github.com/djebel-app-plugins/djebel-creator-links)** - Social media links plugin
- **[djebel-seo](https://github.com/djebel-app-plugins/djebel-seo)** - SEO functionality plugin  
- **[djebel-lang](https://github.com/djebel-app-plugins/djebel-lang)** - Language management plugin

These plugins demonstrate best practices and show you exactly how to build your own Djebel plugins.

## üèóÔ∏è Core Philosophy: Everything is a Plugin

Djebel's revolutionary approach means **everything** is optional. Want a contact form? Install a plugin. Need user authentication? There's a plugin for that. Want a rich text editor? You decide which one fits your project.

This isn't just modularity ‚Äî it's **intentional minimalism**. Your application only loads what it actually uses, resulting in lightning-fast performance.

## üì¶ The Three Types of Plugins

Djebel organizes plugins into three distinct categories, each serving a specific purpose:

### 1. System Plugins (Load First)
These are the foundation layer ‚Äî plugins that other plugins depend on. Think core utilities, security frameworks, and essential services.

**Example Use Case:** A database connection plugin that other plugins rely on.

### 2. Shared Plugins
Perfect for **agencies, hosting companies, and multi-app developers**, these plugins run across multiple sites or applications from a single installation. When Djebel is installed in a shared environment, you can configure a set of plugins that **always load automatically** to set up common functionality across all your apps.

**Real-World Examples:** 

*Hosting company deployment:*
- Security monitoring plugin
- Performance optimization plugin  
- Backup management plugin
- Custom branding plugin

*Multi-app developer setup:*
- Authentication plugin (shared login across apps)
- API client plugin (common third-party integrations)
- Logging plugin (centralized error tracking)
- Theme framework plugin (consistent UI components)

All sites/apps automatically inherit these shared plugins while maintaining their own individual plugins. One installation, managed centrally, deployed everywhere.

### 3. Regular Plugins  
Your standard feature plugins ‚Äî contact forms, galleries, user management, etc. These make up the bulk of your application's functionality.

## üé£ Hooks and Filters: WordPress-Inspired Extensibility

If you've worked with WordPress, you'll feel right at home. Djebel uses the same hooks and filters concept, but streamlined for modern development.

### Action Hooks
Register hooks to run when specific events occur in your application.

### Filter Hooks  
Modify content and data as it flows through your application.

### Multiple Hooks with Priorities
Control the order in which your hooks execute using priority values.

## üìù Shortcodes: Dynamic Content Anywhere

Djebel's shortcode system lets you inject dynamic content **anywhere on your page** - in templates, content areas, headers, footers, sidebars, or any HTML file. No need to write PHP in your templates.

### Built-in Shortcodes
Djebel comes with essential shortcodes like `[djebel_date_year]`, `[djebel_page_nav]`, `[djebel_page_content]`, `[djebel_page_footer]`, and more.

### Custom Shortcodes
Register your own shortcodes to inject dynamic content anywhere in your templates.

## ‚ö° Performance: Built for Speed

### The 25ms Rule
Djebel follows a strict performance principle: **If any feature takes more than 25ms to execute, it must be explicitly enabled and is OFF by default.**

This means:
- Core framework loads lightning-fast out of the box
- Heavy features require conscious developer choice
- No surprise performance hits from "convenient" defaults
- Your application stays fast unless you specifically choose otherwise

### Plugin Load Tracking
Djebel tracks how long each plugin takes to load, helping you identify performance bottlenecks and ensuring your application stays fast.

## üöÄ Quick Installation

Djebel is designed for rapid deployment with multiple installation options:

### 1. PHAR (Recommended)
1. **Download** the `djebel-app.phar` file
